Assignment 1: Enhancing Form Layouts with Bootstrap
Objective

Inline Form Layout:
A contact form where input fields and the submit button are aligned horizontally (inline) using Bootstrap's inline form utilities.

Stacked Form Layout:
A stacked form layout where labels are placed above the input fields, ensuring better readability and accessibility on smaller screens.

Objective
The objective is to practice styling forms using Bootstrap's form control classes, adding floating labels for a modern touch, and incorporating form validation for real-time feedback.

Tasks
Style Form Elements:
Use Bootstrap's form-control class to style form inputs for consistent and clean form elements.

Floating Labels:
Implement floating labels on input fields using Bootstrap's form-floating class to enhance the formâ€™s modern look and feel.
